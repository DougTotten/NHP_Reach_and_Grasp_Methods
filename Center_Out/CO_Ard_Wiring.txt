This arduino drives the target-indicator lights (placed in each well), and reads from the capacitive touch sensor.

Optional connections are the red/green/yellow trial indicator lights on the front of the board which cam be used for assisting synchronization between cameras and electrophysiology, and the contact monitor in back of the device to monitor cap-sensor readings. 

Required: 

Lights indicating target location
D3 = top
D4 = right
D5 = bottom
D6 = left

Connections to cap-sensor
3.3V = 3.3V
Grnd = grnd
A4=SDA
A5=SCL

Optional:
D7 = green LED
D8 = red LED
D9 = yellow LED

D10 = output to contact monitor
