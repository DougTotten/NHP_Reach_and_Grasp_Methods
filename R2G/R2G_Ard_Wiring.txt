This arduino drives the trial-ready lights (on either side of the start location), and reads from the capacitive touch sensor.

Optional connections are the red/green/yellow trial indicator lights on the front of the board which can be used for assisting synchronization between cameras and electrophysiology

Required: 
Lights indicating target location
D4 and D5 = trial-ready lights
